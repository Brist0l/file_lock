-> the cipher needs to be customisable
-> add an option of '-h' so that it can hide the file
-> add an option to change the extension of the file (default is the original extension)
-> add an option to change the name (default is the original extension) 
-> add an option to change the perms of the file so a passwd would be required to access it
-> to decipher it add another layer of security which would ask for a passwd (implement after basic stuff 
has been done)

to cipher:

1) read the file 
2) apply some cipher to the file content
3) delete the original file
4) write down the ciphered stuff in a new file with the same name and extension
5) save the properties in the file in ciphered a way 

to decipher:

1) read the ciphered file
2) decipher the stuff
3) read the properies of the file and make a new file in the exact same way and write down the contents
